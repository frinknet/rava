we need to be able to crate seprate luastates with their own threads

also loading modules should be allowed as follows:


thread.lua(1024, function()

	return something
end, "mod1", "mod2")


spawn(memory, chroot, callback, modules ...)

spawn(funct, chroot, memory)



if module "any" is given then they can do a subprocess
and allow the loading of any module otherwise only the modules that they have been
delegated will be allowed if they spawn a thread
